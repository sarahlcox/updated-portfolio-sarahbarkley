# updated-portfolio-sarahbarkley

I updated my portfolio with images, using Lightbox, so when you click on the screenshots a large preview opens up. Also I added links to my deployed websites. 
Link to deployed website: https://sarahlcox.github.io/updated-portfolio-sarahbarkley/.

I used a html validator: https://validator.w3.org/
